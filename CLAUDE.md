# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

A Docker-based isolation wrapper for running Claude Code in a container on macOS with Colima. Limits the blast radius so Claude Code can only write to the mounted repo, not the rest of the host filesystem. Uses AWS Bedrock for authentication.

## Build and Run

```bash
# Build/rebuild the image
docker compose build

# Rebuild from scratch (e.g., to update Claude Code version)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Run Claude Code against a repo
ccage ~/path/to/repo

# Pass args through to claude
ccage ~/path/to/repo --resume
ccage ~/path/to/repo -p "do something"

# Yolo mode — skip all permission prompts (safe because containerized)
ccage -y ~/path/to/repo
```

## Architecture

**`ccage`** (host-side launcher, symlinked to `~/.local/bin/`):
- Takes a repo path, derives a unique container name + Docker volume via md5 hash of the full path
- Runs `docker run` with security hardening (cap_drop ALL, no-new-privileges) and four mounts:
  - Repo at `/workspace` (read-write) — the only writable host path
  - `~/.aws/credentials` read-only for Bedrock auth
  - `~/.claude` read-only at `/host-claude` for settings reuse
  - Per-repo named Docker volume at `/home/claude/.claude` for persistent state
- Uses `md5 -q` (macOS-specific) for hashing — not portable to Linux

**`entrypoint.sh`** (runs inside container on every start):
- Symlinks `~/.claude.json` into the volume so onboarding state persists across `--rm` restarts
- Copies `settings.json` from host read-only mount into writable volume
- Symlinks `CLAUDE.md` and `agents/` from host if present
- Sets `git safe.directory` to handle UID mismatch between host and container

**`Dockerfile`**: Ubuntu 24.04, installs Claude Code via official installer, runs as non-root `claude` user. `jq` is required by the statusLine command in the host's `settings.json`.

**`docker-compose.yml`**: Build-only helper — tags the image as `claude-code:latest`. Not used for running containers (that's `ccage`'s job).

## Key Constraints

- Host `~/.claude` is mounted **read-only** — entrypoint must copy/symlink, never write back
- `~/.claude.json` lives at `$HOME/.claude.json` (outside `$HOME/.claude/`), so the entrypoint symlinks it into the volume
- AWS auth uses long-lived credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` under the `claude-full` profile, via `zalando-aws-cli` on the host
- The `md5 -q` command in ccage is macOS-only; use `md5sum | cut -c1-8` for Linux
