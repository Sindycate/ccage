# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

A Docker-based isolation wrapper for running AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI) in containers on macOS with Colima. Limits the blast radius so the tool can only write to the mounted repo, not the rest of the host filesystem.

## Build and Run

```bash
# Build/rebuild all images
docker compose build

# Build just one image
docker compose build claude
docker compose build codex

# Rebuild from scratch (e.g., to update tool versions)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Run Claude Code against a repo (default)
cage ~/path/to/repo
cage claude ~/path/to/repo

# Run Codex CLI against a repo
cage codex ~/path/to/repo

# Pass args through to the tool
cage ~/path/to/repo --resume
cage ~/path/to/repo -p "do something"

# Yolo mode — skip all permission prompts (safe because containerized)
# Yolo defaults to --net gate (domain-gated networking)
cage -y ~/path/to/repo
cage codex -y ~/path/to/repo

# Explicit network gating without yolo
cage --net gate ~/path/to/repo

# No network at all
cage --net off ~/path/to/repo
```

## Architecture

**`cage`** (host-side launcher, symlinked to `~/.local/bin/`):
- Accepts optional subcommand (`cage claude` or `cage codex`) to select tool; defaults to `claude` (overridable via `CAGE_DEFAULT` in `cage.conf`)
- Takes a repo path, derives a unique container name + Docker volume via md5 hash of the full path
- Loads config from `~/.config/cage/cage.conf` (global) then `<repo>/.cage.conf` (per-project override)
- Runs `docker run` with security hardening (cap_drop ALL, no-new-privileges) and tool-specific mounts:
  - Repo at `/workspace` (read-write) — the only writable host path
  - **Claude (bedrock auth):** `~/.aws/credentials` read-only, `~/.claude` read-only at `/host-claude`
  - **Claude (api-key auth):** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var, `~/.claude` read-only at `/host-claude`
  - **Codex:** `~/.codex` read-only at `/host-codex` for auth, `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var if set
  - Per-repo named Docker volume for persistent state
  - SSH key read-only for git push (if `SSH_KEY` configured)
  - `~/.ssh/known_hosts` read-only (if exists)
- Uses `md5 -q` (macOS-specific) for hashing — not portable to Linux

**`entrypoint.sh`** (runs inside Claude Code container on every start):
- Symlinks `~/.claude.json` into the volume so onboarding state persists across `--rm` restarts
- Copies `settings.json` from host read-only mount into writable volume
- Symlinks `CLAUDE.md` and `agents/` from host if present
- Sets `git safe.directory` to handle UID mismatch between host and container
- Sets `user.name`/`user.email` from env vars (passed from `cage.conf`)
- Writes `~/.ssh/config` with SSH host alias if `SSH_HOST` is set

**`entrypoint-codex.sh`** (runs inside Codex container on every start):
- Copies config/state files from `/host-codex` (read-only mount of `~/.codex`) into writable volume
- Skips `auth.json` when `CODEX_COPY_AUTH=0` (for non-OpenAI providers like zllm)
- Preserves `/workspace` trust across restarts (saves and restores `[projects]` entries in `config.toml`)
- Sets `git safe.directory`, git identity, SSH config (same as Claude entrypoint)
- Execs `codex` instead of `claude`

**`Dockerfile`**: Ubuntu 24.04, installs Claude Code via official installer, runs as non-root `claude` user. `jq` is required by the statusLine command in the host's `settings.json`.

**`Dockerfile.codex`**: Ubuntu 24.04 + Node.js LTS, installs Codex CLI via `npm install -g @openai/codex`, runs as non-root `codex` user.

**`docker-compose.yml`**: Build-only helper — tags images as `claude-code:latest` and `codex:latest`. Not used for running containers (that's `cage`'s job).

**`netgate-proxy.py`** (host-side, runs when `--net gate` is active):
- Python3 forward proxy that gates outbound HTTP/HTTPS by domain
- Handles HTTPS via CONNECT method (sees hostname without TLS decryption)
- Holds unknown domains' connections open while showing a macOS `osascript` dialog
- Saves user decisions to allowlist files in `~/.claude/netgate/`
- Pre-allows AWS and OpenAI domains via `netgate/defaults.json`
- Concurrent requests to the same unknown domain show only one dialog (deduplication via threading.Event)

**`netgate/defaults.json`**: Pre-allowed domain patterns (AWS infrastructure, OpenAI API). Loaded on every proxy start.

## Key Constraints

- Host `~/.claude` is mounted **read-only** — entrypoint must copy/symlink, never write back
- `~/.claude.json` lives at `$HOME/.claude.json` (outside `$HOME/.claude/`), so the entrypoint symlinks it into the volume
- Claude auth is configured via `CLAUDE_AUTH` in `cage.conf`: `bedrock` (mounts `~/.aws/credentials`) or `api-key` (passes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var)
- Codex auth uses `~/.codex/` directory (sign in on host first) or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var. Set `CODEX_COPY_AUTH=0` in `cage.conf` to skip copying `auth.json` (for non-OpenAI providers like zllm)
- The `md5 -q` command in cage is macOS-only; use `md5sum | cut -c1-8` for Linux
- Network gating (`--net gate`) only covers HTTP/HTTPS traffic routed via proxy env vars. Raw TCP/SSH/DNS bypass the proxy (including `git push` over SSH)
- Git push requires `cage.conf` with `SSH_KEY` pointing to an unencrypted private key (passphrase-protected keys need ssh-agent, which is not available in the container)
- Allowlists: global at `~/.claude/netgate/global.json`, per-project at `~/.claude/netgate/project-{hash}.json`
- When `--net gate` is active, cage does NOT use `exec docker run` (needs shell alive for proxy cleanup)
