# Cage Hardening Workflow

Status: active
Started: 2026-07-16
Baseline: `v0.22.5` (`292efb0`)
Working branch: `codex/security-hardening`

## Objective

Remediate the security, correctness, maintainability, and product-trust findings
from the July 2026 technical review while keeping Cage practical for daily use.
The work is complete when every accepted finding is either fixed and covered by
tests, explicitly accepted as a documented limitation, or moved to a bounded
follow-up with an owner and validation plan.

This file is the source of truth for long-running work. It must remain useful
after context compaction, a new agent session, or a maintainer handoff.

## Product-owner constraints

- Automated credential setup is a core usability requirement. Do not make
  manual token management the default remediation.
- Safer credential brokers and short-lived credentials should be additive and
  automated where possible.
- Breaking changes are allowed when migration instructions are complete.
- Intermediate versions may be published. Every pushed commit must have its own
  version and tag, as required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Agents own local, Docker, CI, publication, and anonymous-consumer validation.
  The product owner does not test local `main`, agent worktrees, local commits,
  or locally built images as the normal release gate. Product-owner acceptance
  starts from a fresh `curl` installation only after the new version is public.
- Every tracked in-scope change is release-bound by default, including
  documentation and tests. “Test first” means validate the public release; it
  does not stop the flow before publication. Stop at a prepared local
  checkpoint only for an explicit user request to keep the work local or not
  publish yet.
- Security claims must describe effective behavior, not intended behavior.

## Trust model decision

Cage will distinguish three operating profiles instead of presenting every
launch as the same security boundary:

1. **Strict**: intended for untrusted repositories. No raw host command bridges,
   no direct credential directories, enforced egress, bounded resources, and an
   ephemeral or review-before-export workspace.
2. **Developer**: optimized for low-friction daily work with automated
   credentials and direct repository access. Credential confidentiality and
   writable Git metadata are explicit accepted risks.
3. **Host-integrated**: enables host MCP/command bridges and external side
   effects. The launch plan must identify those capabilities prominently.

The existing behavior maps most closely to Developer or Host-integrated mode.
Mode implementation is a later milestone; current fixes must not make that
separation harder.

## Scope

Included:

- confirmed host write and code-execution primitives;
- generated auth/config lifecycle and preset isolation;
- Netgate exposure, SSRF, resource bounds, and honest product semantics;
- host MCP and command bridge isolation and protocol correctness;
- resource, mount, concurrency, and persistent-state controls;
- configuration validation, starter experience, installer safety, and doctor;
- build/release reproducibility, CI gates, documentation, and migrations;
- adversarial regression tests for every confirmed security defect.

Excluded unless needed by an included fix:

- forcing manual credentials as the normal workflow;
- claiming protection from Docker or host-kernel compromise;
- unrelated feature development;
- a full language rewrite before the immediate escape paths are closed.

## Workflow packets

| ID | Packet | State | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-A | Remove `.mcp.json` host mutation/path injection and isolate host Python imports | complete | adversarial path, import-shadowing, and symlink tests |
| P0-B | Remove stale generated auth/MCP state without adding credential toil | complete | preset-switch and repeat-launch tests |
| P0-C | Harden Netgate listener, resolution, prompts, and resource usage | complete | SSRF, body-limit, prompt, and public-destination tests |
| P1-A | Harden OAuth synchronization and durable-state ownership | verification | malformed, symlink, mtime, account-switch, history-preservation, and race tests |
| P1-B | Harden MCP/host-command bridges and repair relay protocol | verification | auth, argv, legacy-argument compatibility, status, timeout, cleanup, and collision tests |
| P1-C | Add resource limits, mount validation, locking, and crash recovery | pending | real-Docker integration tests |
| P2-A | Repair config schema/editor, trust handling, and starter config | complete | strict-schema and round-trip tests |
| P2-B | Add trust modes, capability manifest, dry-run, and state tooling | pending | CLI acceptance tests and migration guide |
| P2-C | Harden installer, builds, release workflow, and supply chain | verification | CI release gate, installer safety, SBOM/provenance checks |
| P3 | Consolidate architecture and remove duplicated orchestration | complete | behavior parity and cross-platform matrix |

Packet states are `pending`, `in progress`, `verification`, `complete`, or
`deferred`. A packet is not complete merely because code was edited.

## Integration rules

- Preserve pre-existing user changes and keep packet file ownership disjoint
  where parallel work is used.
- Every security fix gets a regression test that fails on the baseline behavior.
- An implementation packet is reviewed against its diff and evidence before
  integration.
- No finding is silently dropped. Rejected or deferred findings must include the
  reason and residual risk in `PROGRESS.md`.
- Compatibility changes must update `MIGRATIONS.md` in the same release.
- A release checkpoint requires the full unit suite, shell/Python syntax checks,
  Compose validation, diff review, and any available focused integration tests.
- External publication is recorded only after commit, push, tag, and workflow
  status are verified.
- A local checkpoint is described as `prepared` or `release candidate`, never
  `done`. Release-bound work reaches handoff only after the exact commit is on
  remote `main`, required CI succeeds, the immutable tag and GitHub Release are
  published, the canonical publisher reaches `public_verified`, and a fresh
  unauthenticated `curl` install reports the expected version.
- `scripts/publish_release.py` is the single controller for an ordinary release.
  Run its real mode once after the prepared commit; `--dry-run` is optional and
  reserved for genuinely ambiguous state or mutation review. Do not duplicate a
  healthy publisher with manual Git/GitHub mutations, routine workflow polling,
  registry reads, installer runs, or another public-verification checklist. Use
  publisher milestones and its final schema-v2 JSON. Required conversational
  heartbeats report the last observed milestone without extra GitHub or registry
  queries. On interruption or failure, resume its private journal and investigate
  only the reported condition before resuming.

## Public evidence hygiene

- Treat every tracked file, commit, tag, workflow log, generated release asset,
  issue, and pull request as public.
- Replace maintainer home paths, account or organization aliases, provider,
  profile and model names, and generated target or volume identifiers with
  stable examples or capability-level descriptions.
- Never paste credential values, unredacted authentication output, private
  configuration, or unredacted scanner reports into tracked evidence.
- Ignored files are not a security boundary: quarantine sensitive local
  artifacts outside every Cage-mounted repository.
- Run the repository secret scan and public-content regression before every
  publication checkpoint. Keep scanner exceptions rule-specific and as narrow
  as the exact verified false positive.

## Release checkpoints

The exact versions may change after integration review.

- **Checkpoint 1 — boundary safety:** P0-A, the safe portion of P0-B, accurate
  warnings, and regression tests. Published source checkpoint: `v0.23.0`;
  release-workflow corrections: `v0.23.1` and `v0.23.2`; macOS/Colima
  bind-path correction: `v0.23.3`; remapped-owner mode correction: `v0.23.4`;
  unauthenticated installer portability correction: `v0.23.5`; Codex
  state-preservation, host-token compatibility, and verifiable-release
  correction attempt: `v0.23.6`; host-UID rules-copy correction: `v0.23.7`;
  fail-closed Codex runtime-state import invariant: `v0.23.8`.
- **Checkpoint 2 — state and network:** remaining P0-B/P0-C plus OAuth and
  concurrency protections.
- **Checkpoint 3 — controlled capabilities:** bridges, limits, mounts, trust
  modes, and launch-plan UX.
- **Checkpoint 4 — maintainability:** configuration, installer, supply chain,
  release gates, and architectural consolidation.

## Approval and publication state

- Local edits, tests, commits, pushes, tags, and intermediate releases are
  authorized by the product owner for this workflow.
- This is standing publication authorization, not an invitation to stop for a
  second approval. Use the canonical publisher and its exact confirmation as
  the mutation guard; if it cannot reach public verification, leave the release
  pending or blocked rather than handing a local candidate to the product owner.
- GitHub CLI authentication was invalid at workflow start. Local work may
  continue, but GitHub publication must not be reported as successful until
  authentication and remote state are verified.
- Destructive cleanup, history rewriting, force-pushes, secret changes, and
  production-environment changes are not authorized.

## Done condition

The workflow is done when:

1. all accepted packets are complete or explicitly deferred with residual risk;
2. migrations describe every breaking behavior change;
3. automated tests cover confirmed escape paths and critical state transitions;
4. documentation matches effective trust boundaries;
5. release artifacts and source revisions are auditable and reproducible enough
   for the documented support level;
6. the final residual-risk register is reviewed with the product owner;
7. any release-bound completion claim is backed by the remote-main, CI, tag,
   GitHub Release, `public_verified`, and fresh public-installer evidence above.

## Compaction and resume instructions

When resuming this hardening workflow after compaction or handoff, inspect
`AGENTS.md`, this workflow, and the current branch status/diff. Find the latest
checkpoint for the active packet in `PROGRESS.md` and its applicable migration
entries in `MIGRATIONS.md`; consult older history only when needed to resolve a
dependency or uncertainty. Unrelated tasks use the task-specific reference map
in `AGENTS.md` instead of loading the hardening history.

For an in-progress release, do not reconstruct or manually replay its phases
after compaction. Invoke the canonical publisher from the matching clean
worktree so it reconciles its private journal with authoritative remote state,
then leave that single process attached through `public_verified`.

Resume the first packet whose state is `in progress`, `verification`, or
`pending`. Do not repeat completed proof-of-concept work. Update `PROGRESS.md`
at every release checkpoint, material decision, repeated failure, or pause.
